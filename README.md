# Installation

To install it right away for all UNIX users:-

```bash
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/madaboutbrighton/sleep/master/sleep.sh -O /usr/local/bin/sleep.sh
sudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/sleep.sh
```

## Usage

```bash
sleep.sh
```
This would shutdown a computer if no users are logged-on, and no `cp`, `mv`, `rsync` or `scp` processses are running. 

```bash
sleep.sh --clients "192.168.1.12 192.168.1.34"
```
This would shutdown a computer if `192.168.1.12` and `192.168.1.34` are not reachable on the network, no users are logged-on, and no `cp`, `mv`, `rsync` or `scp` processses are running. 

```bash
sleep.sh --torrent-level "active_downloads" --torrent-type "transmission" --torrent-password "my_torrent_password"
```
This would shutdown a computer if `transmission` is not actively downloading anything, no users are logged-on, and no `cp`, `mv`, `rsync` or `scp` processses are running. 

```bash
sleep.sh --sony-tvs "192.168.1.67 192.168.1.89" --sony-tv-auth-psk "my_sony_psk"
```
This would shutdown a computer if the Sony TVs `192.168.1.67` and `192.168.1.89` are not active, no users are logged-on, and no `cp`, `mv`, `rsync` or `scp` processses are running.
